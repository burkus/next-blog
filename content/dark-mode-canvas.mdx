Title: How to Dark Mode a Canvas

Dark mode is kind of like how the Romans would grow grass just to flex that they could. Growing something totally worthless 
is the ultimate flex, and so are app features that add large amounts of complexity with virtually no return on investment.

I like building animations/simulations with the canvas element, but what can be frustrating is working with the canvas when in React.
Because the `requestAnimationFrame` function is executed under the global context
you end up with funky behavior that doesn't really fit into the React ethos. 
My rendering functions have to execute outside of React land for performance and browser API reasons. React is awesome but when
you want 30-60fps it's just so much easier to mutate state.

I tried putting in additional state hooks to handle dark mode canvas but this doesn't work because state updates are based upon
reference. When the hook's value is updated, the original reference (which is captured by the closure) becomes worthless.
We can't update that reference unless we make a new closure, which we can't.

```javascript
const draw = () => {
    sine.draw(ctx);
    requestAnimationFrame(() => draw(sine.draw(ctx)));
}

draw();
```

I ran into the same issue with window resizes. My solution to both of these problems was the same: refs and effect hooks.
This lead me to using the DOM as my mutable state. The canvas API will always have access to whichever canvas spawned the context.

This is great because it lets you play in javascript land with the canvas without having to do anything too hacky.

Accessing color using the context:

```javascript
const color = ctx.canvas.backgroundColor;
```

I added the following hook in the root of the app, where the dark mode switch resides.

```javascript
React.useEffect(() => {
    if(canvasRef.current) {
        canvasRef.current.backgroundColor = theme === 'dark' ? 'black' : 'white';
    }
}, [theme])
```
Whenever the dark mode switch is toggled, this will manually update the canvas element.
This is very simple but I had so much trouble finding something that worked I figured it was worth sharing.

and resizing looks like this:

```javascript
const resize = () => {
    canvasRef.current.width = window.innerWidth;
}

window.onresize = resize;
```
In both cases modifying the element itself is a quick, clean way to toggle color in your canvas animations.
